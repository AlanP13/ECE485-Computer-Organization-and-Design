# 32-bit RISC Processor: Design and Implementation with MIPS Pipeline and Hazard Detection

The project involved creating a custom 32-bit RISC processor based on the MIPS processor. The design included implementing a 5-stage pipeline, including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back. The team referred to a minimum subset of ISA to create their own clock cycle per stage, equally assigning them between each stage. They also implemented a forward unit and hazard detection unit to overcome hazards in test bench data inputs. The project required a combination of technical skills, including processor design, pipeline implementation, and hazard detection.
